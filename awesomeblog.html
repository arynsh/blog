      <h1>About us!</h1>
      <p>Hello! We are Sharon and Daniel. We live in Seattle, Washington with our
      crazy cats who certainly make our life interesting. Daniel works in IT and
      Sharon is going to school for coding!<p>
    </div>

    <h2>Home Life</h2>

    <p>Our cats are named <span class="kitties"> Marzipan</span> (the mom), <span class="kitties">Isis</span>, and <span class="kitties">Jamie Lee Curtis</span>. Marzipan
    originally gave birth to 5 but we made sure the others went to great homes!
    We are left with what seems the craziest of the bunch! They love to
    frustrate us to no end but we can't help but love them and spoil them!</p>

    <p>Some of our favorite activities include home design (for Sharon), gaming
    (for Daniel) and generally just enjoying the outdoors and often going to
    different parks and museums.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Places</h3>

    <p>We love to go on trips- roadtrips, camping trips, overseas, anywhere! Some of
    our favorites that we've taken together have been camping on the Olympic Peninsula (and getting tribal-caught smoked salmon),
    driving up the California coast (and getting the most amazing fish tacos in Pescadero),
    driving to Eastern Washington, and trips to the UK and Morocco!</p>


    <div class="trip">
    <p>While we were in the UK, we rented a car and was able to stay in several places. We
    spent Halloween in Cambridge, and did a very fun and entertaining ghost tour! We stayed
    on a little farm while there. Next, we headed over to the Yorkshire area where we stayed
    near a victorian planned town called Saltaire. Little did we know that the hotel
    planned a Bonfire night celebration, which we were able to attend (complete
    with fireworks!). Sharon thought the Yorkshire area was the most beautiful
    in the world and if she had a chance, she would move there in a heartbeat!
    We went to several places around the area such as Bolton Abbey, Pateley Bridge
    (which houses the oldest candy shop in England!), the Yorkshire moors, and the walled
    city of York. We then drove towards Wales, stopping first in the walled city of
    Chester. We agreed that Chester is like a miniature York, and we both preferred
    Chester to York due to it's convenient and compact size as well as lack of tourists. In Chester, we had
    a very strange soda called "Lilt" at an amazing fish and chip shop. After Chester,
    we arrived in Wales. We stayed in a 10th century abbey with Roman ruins next door!
    We went to many castles while in Wales and Sharon had an absolute blast! We concluded
    this trip with a few days in London, where we stayed in the Chelsea neighborhood
    as well as in Notting Hill.</p>

    <p>We visited two cities in Morocco: Rabat and Fez. Sharon thought Morocco
    was more humid than she expected. Daniel was surprised at how popular fries and paninis
    were! We greatly enjoyed staying in all the different Riads while there. Riads
    are the traditional style of home/hotel of Morrocco. They feature several floors
    which are all open to interior courtyard living space, which more often than not will
    have a water feature. We also enjoyed having Moroccan style breakfast each morning
    and their very unique method of pouring mint tea! We made a friend while in Fez,
    and he took us to one of his favorite restaurants outside of the medina. Later,
    he took us to have a Moroccan dessert which consists of blended avocado with
    fruit salad. We also toured a park at night with him, and Sharon especially
    enjoyed this aspect because of the shady characters inhabiting this particular park.</p>
